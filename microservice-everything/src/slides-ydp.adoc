Micro Service is an *architectural concept* that aims to decouple a solution by decomposing functionality into discrete services +

* We are talking about scattered services, loosely coupled with HTTP calls
====

[.topic]
== My personal definition

[.incremental]
* A small problem domain [detail]#Bounded Context might be the thing#
* Built and deployed by itself [detail]#standalone and isolated#
* Runs in its own process
* Integrates via well-known interfaces + 
[detail]#While HTTP isn’t always the best answer, it’s a damn fine first guess#
* Owns its own data [detail]#ultimate goal#

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Obviously much depend on context
** Own data might not always be the case (with legacy systems)
* Lot has been said about decoupled services during this conference
** Reactive, vert.x, dropwizard, etc
** I think tthat gives you a certain feeling what's the buzz
====

[.topic]
== Why bother? Modularity at all levels

[.incremental]
* Function 
* Object 
* Class 
* Actor 
* Stream transform 
* *Microservice*

== !
[.statement]
*SOA* done right?

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Is it kind of SOA done right?
* 15 years since the concept of Service Oriented Architecture
* significant changes in the way we think about architecture
** ESB is not always SOA - when the sevices are deeply coupled in a non visible way
* And afterall - are we facing same SOA challanges
** SOA Governance?
** Service discoverability?
====

== !
[.statement]
*Bounded Ctx* + 
gives us a great way of breaking up a domain

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Eric Evan’s - Domain Driven Design
* things evangelised by Slawek Sobotka, Piotr Wyczesany 
* Service interface between each context
* ensure a service is responsible for an aggregate root and all of it’s child domain objects
====

== !
[.statement]
*REST* style interfaces and *JSON* as a data interchange

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* And after that we struggle to document these services
** Swagger, RAML?
* We build contract first (on REST)
** With consumer driven contracts
* We want lightweight but with the same control
** And we start with JSONSchema to design the services
** Yes, we've seen that

*web services* with + 
*micro tools*
[.pull-right]#easier than ever# 

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Marketing? Or is it really something?
* In JAVA world count: 
** Simple embedded Jetty, Spark, Webbit, Dropwizard, Vert.x, Spring Boot
* SOA is old, big bloated, corporate, 
** Eclipse based drag and drop (Mule IDE, Active VOS, WSO2 IDE)
* Now we build pretty much the same - but through code? Right?

[.topic]
== Some problems with monolythic architecture

[.middle.incremental]
* Even when layered, hidden coupling
* Single runtime, allows in memory calls
* FUD: if it works don't fix it [detail]#don't touch it# 
* Good diagrams not always make it to good code

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* I know this might not always be true
** Though it usually happens
====


[.topic]
== The beshitted legacy system 

[.middle.incremental]
* don't touch it approach [detail]#as if you meant it#
* write a small service that does what's needed +
[detail]#instead of diving into legacy system#
* evole the architecture

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Working with legacy code is risky at best
* We all know it

[.small.quote, Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month]
____
Problems of developing software derive from essential complexity and its nonlinear increases with size; leading to difficulty of communication among team members, cost overruns, schedule delays.
____

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* If your program get longer, it take more time to develop
* I'm not talking about the *product flaws* it can cause. Leave it out of scope for the time being
* You think you need more people
** But you can't get around by hiring more people
** Because beyond a certain size new hires are actually a net lose
* Keeping things micro is a way for me to limit the size 
====

[.topic.recap.red-border]
== Takeaway

[.statement]
Separate things that change with a +
*different pace*

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* That was my first outcome
====

[.topic.recap.red-border]
== Takeaway

[.statement]
The is no such thing as legacy +
If noone use it - abandon it + 
If you can't - it's business as usual + 
[pull-right]#*cope with it!*#

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* My second outcome.
* If there was no way to fight them - join them 
* If we build the system in such a way - we are unable to change it - we are definatelly fucked!
====

[.topic.recap.red-border]
== Takeaway
[.statement]
If you get the mindset +
*everything is a* +
[pull-right]#*service*# +
just not always very micro

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* That brings me to another example
* Depending on your definition, what is microservice
** How micro should be the service
** Or size doesnt matter - but responsibility
* If you bound the context, aggregate - is it enough for microservice
====

[.topic]
== Get more practical?!?!?!

* How to package?
* How to deploy?
* How to scale?
* How to orchestrate?
* How to monitor?
* How to discover?

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Are we going to throw 20+ services on our operations??
