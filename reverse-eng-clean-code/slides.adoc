Put some *real slide* in here

* Bartosz, Arquillian Persistence Extension. The true opensource warrior.
* I'd like to tell you a story how I went the path Bartosz described
** How I went beyond my daily job
* Reverse engineering the clean code
** Not in a way you turn a _class_ file into _java_ file
** In a way Mitnick reversed security through it's social aspects

* Back in 2008 I was laying down code, best I could - like most people did.
* There better and worse examples. I did was constatly improving. 
** At least that's what I tought when I looked back my old code

* one day I realized there can and must be a beaty in code
** prolly when I first time compared Calendar API and JodaTime
** or looked up Guava (called Google Collections at that time)

[.topic]
== Clean code in a nutshell 

[.incremental]
* name variableslike this
* don't use comments; unless
* split functions and keep them small
* ... blah blah blah... abstractions
* Law of Demeter
* test, test, test 
* red, green, refactor

====
* The rules. *The dogmna*
* I realized my craft was improving
** I felt like I had this rules tatoos at my arm
* But yet another realization came
** Do I do this to keep the code maintanable, easier to change
** I kept focus beter
* My team mates are more eager to change my code
* I realized clean code wasn't on it's own. It was a result. *Not the cause*

* That way I got to Kent Beck
* The clean code was the effect. The cause was somewhere else
** I know Uncle Bob was ranting about implementation patterns in clean code book. *I don't care*
* Kent has given this different perspective on what was important
** what the implementation was really about
====

== The Values

[.middle.incremental]
* Communication [detail]#program should read like a book#
** [detail]#spend more time reading existing code than writing new code#
* Simplicity [detail]#delete everything that don't add information#
** [detail]#enable reading, using and modifying programs more quickly#
* Flexibility [detail]#is complexity, so add only when it's needed#
** [detail]#as if it was that easy#

[NOTE]

* That was an a-ha moment. Kind of flash

* Now I know where it's comming all from
* That might be how you feel when you get all that
** Or you can dig harder and deeper
