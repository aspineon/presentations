* I'd like to tell you a story how I went the path of craftmanship
** How I went beyond my daily job
* Reverse engineering the clean code
** Not in a way you turn a _class_ file into _java_ file
** In a way Mitnick reversed security through it's social aspects
* Back in 2008 I was laying down code, best I could - like most people did.
* There better and worse examples. I did was constatly improving.
** At least that's what I tought when I looked back my old code

* one day I realized there can and must be a beaty in code
** prolly when I first time compared Calendar API and JodaTime
** or looked up Guava (called Google Collections at that time)

* I also understood several other things
* Some quite universal metrics
* Now we all know it, regardless of the language
* I think I can always smell the crappy code.

====
* And I just though maybe instead of a classical lecture I'll do a refactoring kata
* After all - it's the first code I've seen with 15k
** Quite a mountain
* And we all have fun from this code, from the approach
* We can spend hours discussing openness of public founded projects etc
* But we also can have a discussion why the program is such a crap
** Or what would be the implications
====

[.topic]
== Complex vs complicated

[.incremental]
Simple to read, learn and understand::
How easy it’s for novice programmer to maintain a significant program

Make stuff simple but not simplistic::

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* complex vs complicated – this might be one of the discussion point.
* We can talk verbosity of the language Javy vs. Groovy
** We can talk ESB looks simple on diagrams
* Mythical man-month. Inherent and accidental complexity
** Or complex vs complicated.

* Now I know where it's comming all from
* You can feel like a boss. Sometimes being a bit superior and dicky
* That might be how you feel when you get all that
** Or you can dig harder and deeper
** Look for some other inspirations. Go beyond beauty in code, cause it's not about beauty
* But yet another realization came
** Do I do this to keep the code maintanable, easier to change
** I kept focus beter
* My team mates are more eager to change my code
* I realized clean code wasn't on it's own. It was a result. *Not the cause*

[.incremental]
* Code is the communication's foundation

[.topic]
== Implementation patterns

[.incremental]
Communication::
Read code like a prose

Simplicity::
Be aware of complexity and add when essential

Local consequences::
Data and behaviour together

[.topic]
== Implementation patterns

[.incremental]
DRY::
minimize repetition

Symmetry::
Keep the same level of abstraction

== \\

[.small.quote, Grady Booch, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications]
____
Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designers’ intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.
